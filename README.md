# Bad Translate
You know those mods about video games\
that translate the game content so many times that it becomes literal gibberish ?\
Well now you can do that in the comfort of your terminal

You could also add your own custom `lang-list.json`!\
This is just a silly app, so if anything breaks, its on you.
